<h>Live Project</h>
For my last two weeks at The Tech Academy, I completed a two-week Agile sprint with a small group of my peers, which involved taking and completing tasks to showcase my data science skills. Using Jupyter Notebooks, I analyzed data and then created visualizations for a variety of user stories with Python. These tasks utilized NOAA historical climate data from 1993-1994, Covid-19 case data over 2020-2021, Google Play app store data, and NBA statistics over 1950-2021. 
<h>Climate Data</h>

<h>Covid-19</h>
First user story: Separate Covid-19 case data by country in order to create new dataframes for analysis. Find average new case rate for each country. 
Second user story: Find correlations between variables in order to find out whether certain factors cause total cases to go up or down. In particular, vaccination numbers, GDP/poverty, age, history of smoking, population density, and preexisting conditions. 
Third user story: Analyze which countries have had the best response to Covid-19, and which have had the worst response. 
<h>Google Play</h>
First user story: Find how many apps in the Entertainment category of the Google Play store have a rating of "Mature."
Second user story: Separate apps in the Google Play store by category, then isolate the Entertainment, Social, and Productivity categories. Analyze how many of these apps are free or paid, the highest and lowest priced apps for each category, and the top 5 highest priced apps along with their category. 
Third user story: Group the apps in the Google Play store by app category, then separate by content rating. Determine which content rating has the highest number of installs and report on the app categories in that list. 
<h>NBA</h>
First user story: Analyze when contract extensions for NBA players become risky. When in their careers do players hit their peak in terms of performance? Does team affect this?
Second user story: Use free throws and total points score to determine the value of free throws in relation to a player's performance.

<h>Other Skills Learned</h>
-Working with other developers 
-Agile/Scrum methodology
-Using GitHub to improve project flow 
-Bug triage and resolution
  -When we ran into trouble with our code, we were encouraged to use our own problem-solving skills first, before requesting the assistance of an instructor. I learned to use the skills that I had already acquired, and especially the terminology that I remembered, to use resources such as StackOverflow, GitHub, Youtube, and other online forums to practice and apply solutions to any coding issues or error messages that I was running into.
